  This is mostly trageted to festivel goers and the rave community as perler necklaces and bracelets are worn to these events. <br>
  These items can also target kids, teens, and young adults as the other items can be bought as gifts. <br>
  As mentioned before, these items are customizable, meaning the buyers will submit a photo they want as a perler item.

<h2>Idea 2: Unique Cookies</h2>
